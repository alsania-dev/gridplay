"Your Grid. Their Game. Instant Glory."
Digital Sports Squares Made Easy, Fair, and Fun!
Ready to revolutionize sports squares? Launch your GridPlay board today—no spreadsheets, no stress, just wins!

## Elevator Pitch:
Tired of messy spreadsheets, cash piles, and manual score-checking for your sports squares game? GridPlay automates the classic sports betting experience, turning chaotic paper grids into sleek, real-time digital boards. Host or join games in seconds, buy squares securely, and let the app handle live scores, random number assignments, and instant payouts—perfect for Super Bowl parties, March Madness, or casual game nights!

## How It Works:
1. **Create or Join a Board**
   - Choose an upcoming sports game. The system will automatically assign the playing teams on the board.
   - Choose from Shotgun Boards (Halftime and Final), 10x10 (classic 100 squares), or 5x5 (25 square mini-grid).
   - Choose or Set squares value (each board will have squares the same value, this 5x5 board is $1 per square. this 5x5 board is $5 per square, etc.) and for premium users, set your house cut (default 10%).

2. **Buy Squares Digitally**
   - Users claim squares via Stripe, PayPal, or crypto.
   - Squares are marked instantly with their username—no duplicates!

3. **Auto-Assign Numbers**
   - After squares sell out, the app randomly assigns 0-9 digits to rows/columns (ensuring fairness).

4. **Track Scores Live**
   - Integrates with ESPN/SportsRadar APIs to auto-update scores by quarter/halftime/final.
   - Winners are highlighted in real time.

5. **Win & Cash Out Instantly**
   - Payouts split by quarter (e.g., 16% for Q1, 24% for halftime).
   - Winnings go straight to users’ wallets or bank accounts.

## Game Modes:
1. **Shotgun Board (2-Row Quick Play)**
   - Top row = Halftime, Bottom row = Final Score.
   - Last digit of each teams score added wins (e.g., 23-17 → 3+7=10 → 0 wins).
   - Payout: 90% of the total pot for that row (Halftime and Final). Example: $1 per square pays $9 to halftime winner and $9 to final winner, house cut 10% ($2).

2. **Classic 10x10 & 5x5 Grids**
   - 10x10: Match column (home team) and row (visitors) digits for each quarter.
   - 5x5: Double digits per row/column for faster action.
   - Each square has a chance to win in all 4 quarters. Your square could win them all.
   - Payouts: 16% (Q1), 24% (halftime), 16% (Q3), 32% (final), 12% house.
